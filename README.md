    # The Phase Transition of Task-Solvability

    This repository contains the Python simulation code for the paper: *"The Phase Transition of Task-Solvability: Quantum Evasion of a Classical Computational Limit"*.

    The script `simulator.py` implements the Monte Carlo simulation of a classical agent on a 2D triangular lattice, as described in the Methods section of the paper. It generates the necessary data to reproduce Figures 1 and 2.

    ## How to Run

    1.  Ensure you have `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed in your Python environment. If not, run:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
